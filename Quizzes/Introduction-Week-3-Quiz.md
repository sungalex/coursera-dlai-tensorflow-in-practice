# Introduction - Week 3 Quiz

1. What is a Convolution?

   - [X] A technique to isolate features in images
   - [ ] A technique to make images bigger
   - [ ] A technique to make images smaller
   - [ ] A technique to filter out unwanted images

2. What is a Pooling?

   - [ ] A technique to isolate features in images
   - [ ] A technique to combine pictures
   - [ ] A technique to make images sharper
   - [X] A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features

3. How do Convolutions improve image recognition?

   - [X] They isolate features in images
   - [ ] They make processing of images faster
   - [ ] They make the image clearer
   - [ ] They make the image smaller

4. After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?

   - [X] 26x26
   - [ ] 31x31
   - [ ] 28x28
   - [ ] 25x25

5. After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?

   - [ ] 56x56
   - [ ] 26x26
   - [ ] 28x28
   - [X] 13x13

6. Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:

   - [X] It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
   - [ ] Faster
   - [ ] Stay the same
   - [ ] Slower
